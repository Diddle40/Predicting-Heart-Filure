### A machine Learning project; predicting  heart failure in an individual

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

#### About the Project:
###### Python was used for the entirety of the project.
- Data Collection: Data was openly gotten from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.
- Data Preprocessing: Libraries like Pandas and numpy was used to clean the data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Matplotlib and Seaborn was used to explore and identify patterns with relationship captured in summary plot.
- Model Evaluation and Building: Feature Engineering was done to select most important features for modelling to avoid noise. Different Classification models were used to predict result.
- Model Tuning: Tuning was done to optimise each results from each result.

  Conclusion: The better model for this was found to be Gradient Boosting Classifier with a tuned accuracy score of 0.855 and AOC of 0.908
